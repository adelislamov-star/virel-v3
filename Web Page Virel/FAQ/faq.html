Its purpose is to provide security for both you and the companion. For the companion, it confirms the client's firm intention to proceed with the meeting, compensating for the time they have reserved. For you, the client, it secures your chosen companion for a specific date and time, ensuring they are committed to your arrangement."

In the rare event of a cancellation initiated by the agency or the companion, your deposit is fully and immediately refundable."

If you cancel a booking with more than 48 hours' notice, your deposit is typically fully refundable or can be held for a future booking. If you cancel within 48 hours of the agreed meeting time, the deposit is usually non-refundable, as the companion has reserved that time exclusively for you."

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, we accommodate same-day bookings and understand that spontaneity can be part of the experience. We recommend contacting us as early as possible on the day to ensure the best availability of your preferred companion. While we always do our best to fulfil last-minute requests, availability can be limited, especially during peak times or with our most in-demand companions. A few hours of advance notice significantly increases the likelihood of securing your desired arrangement without compromise. For the most immediate service, we suggest calling us directly, as this allows our team to check real-time availability and confirm your booking in the quickest possible timeframe.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Authenticity is a cornerstone of our agency's reputation. We are committed to ensuring that the companions you see on our website are the individuals you will meet. All companions undergo a verification process, and we require that their portfolio images are recent and accurately represent their current appearance. We understand that trust begins with transparency, and misrepresentation undermines that trust. While professional photography is used to capture our companions in the best light, we have strict guidelines to prevent any misleading alterations. Our aim is for you to make your choice with confidence, assured that the person who arrives is the same individual presented on our website.</p>

            <h2>Deposits &amp; Payments: Our Financial Framework</h2>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h3>Why is a deposit required for some bookings?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>A deposit serves as a mutual commitment and is typically requested only for extended bookings, first-time clients, or arrangements involving significant travel. Its purpose is to provide security for both you and the companion. For the companion, it confirms the client's firm intention to proceed with the meeting, compensating for the time they have reserved and the other bookings they may have declined. For you, the client, it secures your chosen companion for a specific date and time, ensuring they are committed to your arrangement. This framework fosters a professional and reliable process, reducing the uncertainty of last-minute changes and ensuring that both parties can proceed with confidence and peace of mind.</p>

                <h3>How is my deposit protected?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Your deposit is a trust-based financial commitment, and we treat it with the highest level of responsibility. When you pay a deposit, it is held by the agency as a safeguard for the booking. It is not disbursed until after the meeting is successfully completed. In the rare event of a cancellation initiated by the agency or the companion, your deposit is fully and immediately refundable. We provide clear terms outlining the conditions for deposit refunds in our Cancellations &amp; Changes section. This transparent approach ensures your funds are protected and that you are not financially disadvantaged by circumstances outside of your control. Our goal is to make the financial process as secure and clear as the rest of our service.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>To ensure discretion and simplicity, our primary method of payment is cash, paid directly to the companion at the beginning of your meeting. We accept British Pounds (GBP), and some companions may also accept Euros (EUR) or US Dollars (USD), which should be confirmed at the time of booking. For deposits, we facilitate secure bank transfers. We currently do not process credit card payments directly for the final balance to minimise the data we hold and protect your financial privacy. This cash-based approach is standard within the industry and is often preferred by clients for its straightforwardness and lack of a digital trail, aligning with our commitment to a discreet and confidential service.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>For the sake of clarity and to ensure a relaxed experience, the final balance for the meeting is settled at the very beginning. Upon the companion's arrival, you are asked to present the agreed-upon fee in cash. This practice is standard and serves to handle the financial aspect of the arrangement upfront, allowing the rest of the time to be focused on companionship without business formalities. It provides peace of mind for both you and the companion, confirming that all obligations are met from the outset. This transparent and professional approach prevents any potential awkwardness or misunderstanding later on, ensuring the focus remains on a positive and enjoyable experience for the duration of your time together.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Our screening process is a discreet and respectful measure designed to create a secure environment for both our clients and companions. For new clients, this typically involves a brief confirmation of the details you provide, ensuring the information is accurate and the booking is legitimate. We do this to prevent frivolous or malicious bookings, which protects the time and safety of our companions. The process is not intrusive and is handled with the utmost professionalism. It exists not as a barrier, but as a foundational layer of trust. By verifying each booking, we ensure that all parties are genuine and share a mutual understanding of the professional nature of the arrangement, fostering a safer and more reliable experience for everyone.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Safety is a shared responsibility that we take very seriously. For outcall meetings, we maintain a record of the location and have a discreet check-in procedure with the companion to confirm their safe arrival and departure. This ensures that the agency is aware of their whereabouts and that the meeting is proceeding as planned. Companions are trained to handle situations professionally and have the full support of the agency to end any meeting where they feel unsafe or disrespected. We ask that our clients contribute to this safe environment by being respectful and communicating clearly. These measures are in place to protect both parties and to ensure that the experience is not only enjoyable but also conducted within a secure and professional framework.</p>

                    <p>We understand the desire to ensure a good connection, but for safety and privacy reasons, we do not facilitate pre-booking meetings. Arranging such a meeting creates significant logistical and security challenges for our companions, whose privacy and time we must protect. Their professional commitment begins at the agreed-upon booking time. Our website is designed to provide a comprehensive and accurate portrayal of each companion, including their personality and interests, to help you make an informed choice. We also encourage you to speak with our client managers, who know the companions personally and can offer genuine insights to help you select someone who aligns with your expectations, ensuring a better match without compromising our essential security protocols.</p>

                    <p>Your comfort and safety are paramount. If at any point during a meeting you feel uncomfortable or that the boundaries of the agreed arrangement are not being respected, you have the absolute right to end the meeting. We encourage open and respectful communication from the outset to establish mutual expectations. However, should a situation arise that cannot be resolved, you should politely and calmly end the appointment. We ask that you inform the agency of the situation afterwards, so we can take appropriate action and ensure our standards of conduct are upheld. Similarly, our companions are instructed to do the same. This policy of mutual respect is fundamental to ensuring a professional and positive experience for all.</p>

                <h3>What happens if I need to cancel or reschedule my booking?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>We understand that plans can change. If you need to cancel or reschedule, we ask that you provide us with as much notice as possible to allow us to manage the companion's schedule. For cancellations made with more than 24 hours' notice, there is generally no financial penalty. For cancellations made with less notice, a fee may be applicable to compensate the companion for the time they had reserved for you. This is especially true for outcall bookings where the companion may already be travelling. Our goal is to be fair to both our clients and our companions, and our policy is designed to reflect the mutual commitment made at the time of booking. Please call us directly to discuss any changes to your arrangements.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>In the rare and unfortunate event that a companion must cancel a booking due to illness or an emergency, we will notify you immediately. Our first priority will be to offer you a suitable alternative companion for the same time slot. If we are unable to find a replacement that meets your satisfaction, or if you prefer not to proceed, any deposit you have paid will be refunded in full without delay. We believe in professional accountability, and it is our responsibility to manage such situations with transparency and fairness. Your trust is important to us, and we would never leave you in a difficult position due to a cancellation on our part. Our commitment is to provide a reliable service, and that includes how we handle unforeseen circumstances.</p>

                <h3>Is the deposit refundable if I cancel?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>The refundability of a deposit depends on the timing of your cancellation. If you cancel a booking with more than 48 hours' notice, your deposit is typically fully refundable or can be held for a future booking. If you cancel within 48 hours of the agreed meeting time, the deposit is usually non-refundable. This is because the companion has reserved that time exclusively for you and has likely turned down other opportunities. The deposit serves to partially compensate them for this loss of income. We believe this policy strikes a fair balance, respecting the client's need for flexibility while also honouring the companion's professional commitment and time. We aim for transparency in these matters to avoid any misunderstanding.</p>

                    <p>A no-show or a cancellation made with very little notice (e.g., within a few hours of the meeting time) creates a significant disruption for the companion, who has dedicated their time and may have incurred travel expenses. In such cases, any deposit paid will be forfeited. For clients with a history of last-minute cancellations or no-shows, we may require a full prepayment for any future bookings. This policy is not intended to be punitive, but rather to ensure the reliability and professionalism of the service for all parties. We value the time and commitment of our companions and expect our clients to do the same. Clear communication and timely notice are key to maintaining a respectful and functional relationship.</p>

This data is stored securely on encrypted systems with strictly limited access. Our team is trained in data protection and bound by confidentiality agreements. We do not share your information with any third parties for marketing or other purposes, unless required by law or for reasons directly related to ensuring the safety and security of the booking. We use discreet communication methods for all confirmations and correspondence.

                    <p>Our data retention policy is guided by the principle of minimalism. We keep the details of your booking only for as long as is necessary to successfully manage the appointment and for a short period afterwards to handle any post-booking queries. After this period, typically 72 hours, all personally identifiable information related to the booking is permanently deleted from our active systems. We do not maintain a long-term database of client information. This policy is in place to minimise your digital footprint and provide you with the assurance that your association with our agency is not stored indefinitely. Your privacy is not just a promise, but a core part of our operational procedure.</p>

Your contact information is used exclusively for operational communication related to your bookings, such as confirmations, updates, or addressing any queries you may have. We will never use your phone number or email address to send you promotional materials, newsletters, or unsolicited offers. We believe that our clients value discretion above all else, and intrusive marketing is a direct violation of that trust. Our business grows through reputation and the quality of our service, not through marketing lists.
